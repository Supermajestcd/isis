*_Viewmodels_* and *_Entities_* are specializations of *_Domain Objects_*.

_Domain Objects_ have *_Properties_*, *_Collections_* and *_Actions_*,
while _Viewmodels_ are (lifecycle-) managed by _Apache Isis_,
_Entities_ are managed by the configured persistence layer
(either JDO or JPA).

*_Services_* in general are (lifecycle-) managed by _Spring_.
We distinguish between _Services_ that are *_included_* in the metamodel
and those that are not. Included _Services_ we call *_Domain Services_*,
and their _Actions_ (like _Domain Objects_) are part of the metamodel.

Those _Actions_ are either visible as _Menu Actions_ in the UI
and/or made available for the _Restful Objects Viewer_.
(As indicated by the so called _Service's_ *_Nature_*.)

*_Mixins_* do *_contribute_* either a _Property_, a _Collection_
or an _Action_ to their *_Mixee_* (-type).
