Included with the framework are two catalogues of libraries:

* xref:valuetypes:ROOT:about.adoc[Value Type Catalog]
+
Implementations of various value types, eg Markdown.
+
Each will have an applib submodule (for use within the domain logic) as well as various extension modules to be made available to the framework itself (to teach it how to persist or render the value type).

* xref:extensions:ROOT:about.adoc[Extensions Catalog]
+
Describes a number of extensions to the various components that make up the framework.
+
For example, the "Excel Download" extension allows collections to be downloaded as an Excel `.xlsx` spreadsheet in the Wicket viewer.
