:page-partial:

As part of the release process we xref:post-release-successful.adoc#generate-website[generate] and publish the website.
An (intentional) side-effect of this process is to create a branch for the release (that is, `{page-causewayrel}`).
This branch can then be used for documentation updates.

== Update docs

In the regular `causeway` repo:

* Check out the branch:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout {page-causewayrel}
----

* make documentation updates, and commit changes

* make sure config properties are up-to-date:
+
This is most easily done by rebuilding all:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
pushd bom
mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dreleased
popd
----
+
Though it might be sufficient to just build the core/config module
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn clean install -pl core/config
----


* make sure the tooling is also built:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn -D module-tooling -D skip.essential install -DskipTests
----

* generate the website:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
sh preview.sh
----
+
This will write to `antora/target/site`; we'll use the results in the xref:#publish-website[next section].
+
NOTE: this requires Java 11 for the projdoc tooling.
