[#__isis_save_]
=== __isis_save()

Programmatic equivalent of invoking save for a transient object .

NOTE: domain classes may not have a method with this name. The `__isis_` prefix is intended to reduce the risk of a collision.

[#__isis_wrapped_]
=== __isis_wrapped()

Provide access to the underlying, wrapped object.

Used to unwrap objects used as arguments to actions (otherwise, end up creating a `ObjectSpecification` for the Javassist-enhanced class, not the original class).

NOTE: domain classes may not have a method with this name. The `__isis_` prefix is intended to reduce the risk of a collision.

 *NOTE: there is a string-literal reference to this name `DomainObjectInvocationHandler` , so it should not be changed.* .

[#__isis_executionModes_]
=== __isis_executionModes()

The xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/control/ExecutionMode.adoc[ExecutionMode] (s) inferred from the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/control/SyncControl.adoc[SyncControl] with which this wrapper was _WrapperFactory#wrap(Object, SyncControl) created_ .
