[#viewModelMemento_]
=== viewModelMemento()

Obtain a memento of the view model.

Instances of xref:refguide:applib:index/ViewModel.adoc[ViewModel] must include a public single _String_ argument constructor, that recreates an instance from a memento string. This constructor is not required to resolve injection points or fire domain events, instead this responsibility is encapsulated with the framework.
