Value types (or value objects) are building blocks of domain objects (entities and view models), used as the data types for the object's properties.

For complete support:

* the framework must now how to render and parse the values (the UI/presentation)
* the framework must now how to encode/decode the value (if used in a view model)
* the persistence mechanism (xref:pjpa::about.adoc[JPA] or xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO]) must know how to persist the value

The framework supports a large number of JDK value types (strings, dates, numbers), and provides an additional set of value types; see the xref:#built-in[sections] xref:#framework-defined[below].

The xref:valuetypes:ROOT:about.adoc[] provides a set of optional value types that can also be added to your application.

You can also define custom value types.
This topic is also discussed in the xref:valuetypes:ROOT:about.adoc[].


[#built-in]
== Built-in

Apache Isis can render and persist all of the JDK primitives and wrapper classes, and a number of other JDK classes that represent value types.

In addition to primitives, the JDK Classes supported are:

* the wrapper classes:

** `java.lang.Boolean`, `java.lang.Character`, `java.lang.Double`, `java.lang.Float`, `java.lang.Long`, `java.lang.Integer`, `java.lang.Short`, `java.lang.Byte`

* `java.lang.String`

* numeric data types:

** `java.math.BigDecimal`
** `java.math.BigInteger`

* dates in the `java.time` package:

** `java.time.LocalTime`
** `java.time.LocalDate`
** `java.time.LocalDateTime`
** `java.time.OffsetDateTime`
** `java.time.OffsetTime`
** `java.time.ZonedDateTime`

* dates in the `java.sql` package:

** `java.sql.Date`
** `java.sql.Time`
** `java.sql.Timestamp`

* dates in the `java.util` package:

** `java.util.Date`

* images:

** `java.awt.BufferedImage`

* URLs

** `java.net.URL` - for external URLs

* identifiers

** `java.util.UUID` q



[#framework-defined]
== Framework-defined

The framework also defines a number of custom value types:

* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Blob.adoc[Blob] - eg to represent application/pdf
* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Clob.adoc[Clob]
* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Markup.adoc[Markup]
* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/LocalResourcePath.adoc[LocalResourcePath]
* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Password.adoc[Password]
