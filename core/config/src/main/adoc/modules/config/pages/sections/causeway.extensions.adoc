[[causeway.extensions.secman.seed.admin.namespace-permissions.sticky]]
causeway.extensions.secman.seed.admin. +
namespace-permissions.sticky

|
| The set of namespaces to which the admin role is granted.

These namespaces are intended to be sufficient to allow users with this admin role to be able to administer the security module itself, for example to manage users and roles. The security user is not necessarily able to use the main business logic within the domain application itself, though.

These roles cannot be removed via user interface

WARNING: normally these should not be overridden. Instead, specify additional namespaces using ``NamespacePermissions#getAdditional()``.

@see NamespacePermissions#getAdditional()

[[causeway.extensions.secman.seed.admin.password]]
causeway.extensions.secman.seed.admin. +

Users with this role (in particular, the default admin user are granted access to a set of namespaces (``NamespacePermissions#getSticky()`` and ``NamespacePermissions#getAdditional()``) which are intended to be sufficient to allow users with this admin role to be able to administer the security module itself, for example to manage users and roles.

@see Admin#getUserName() @see NamespacePermissions#getSticky() @see NamespacePermissions#getAdditional()


|
[[causeway.extensions.secman.seed.admin.user-name]]
causeway.extensions.secman.seed.admin. +
user-name

|
| The name of the security super user.

This user is automatically made a member of the admin role, from which it is granted permissions to administer other users.

The password for this user is set in ``Admin#getPassword()``.

[[causeway.extensions.secman.seed.regular-user.role-name]]
causeway.extensions.secman.seed. +
regular-user.role-name

causeway.extensions.secman. +
user-menu-me-action-policy

|
| Whether the presence of SecMan should result in the automatic suppression of the ``UserMenu``'s me action.

This is normally what is required as SecMan's ``ApplicationUser`` is a more comprehensive representation of the current user. If the default me action is not suppressed, then the end-user will see two actions with the name "me" in the tertiary menu.

[[causeway.extensions.secman.user-registration.initial-role-names]]
causeway.extensions.secman. +
user-registration. +
initial-role-names
