Quartz is (according to their link:https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/[website]) a richly featured, open source job scheduling library that can be integrated within virtually any Java application.

We can configure Quartz to run ``Job``s using xref:userguide:btb:headless-access.adoc[headless access], for numerous use cases, most commonly involving the polling of work to be performed in the background.
For example:

* period archiving of data to another system, eg blob images to S3
* aggregating data
* proactively monitoring health/status

In simple use cases, Spring Boot's link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-quartz[integration] with Quartz can be used without bringing in a dependency on this extension.

This extension supports the use case where there is a requirement to pass state from one invocation of a ``Job`` to the next.


== Simple use case

The simple use case (that _doesn't_ require a dependeny on this extension) is demonstrated in the xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp] starter app.

* add the dependency (eg to the webapp module):
+
[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-quartz</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>                                         <!--.-->
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-logging</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
----
<.> to avoid Slf4j <--> log4j2 cyclic dependency

* implement quartz's `Job` interface:
+
[source,java]
.SampleJob.java
----
@Component
@RequiredArgsConstructor(onConstructor_ = {@Inject})
@Slf4j
public class SampleJob implements Job {

    private final InteractionService interactionService;         // <1>
    private final TransactionalProcessor transactionalProcessor; // <1>

    @Override
    public void execute(JobExecutionContext context) throws JobExecutionException {
        // ...
    }
}
----
<1> for xref:userguide:btb:headless-access.adoc[headless access] to the domain object model.

* Set up beans to act as the trigger factory and a job factory:
+
[source,java]
.QuartzModule.java
----
@Configuration
@ComponentScan
public class QuartzModule {

    private static final int REPEAT_INTERVAL_SECS = 60;
    private static final int START_DELAY_SECS = 20;
    private static final int MILLIS_PER_SEC = 1000;

    @Bean
    public JobDetailFactoryBean jobDetail() {
        val jobDetailFactory = new JobDetailFactoryBean();
        jobDetailFactory.setJobClass(SampleJob.class);
        jobDetailFactory.setDescription("Invoke Sample Job service...");
        jobDetailFactory.setDurability(true);
        return jobDetailFactory;
    }

    @Bean
    public SimpleTriggerFactoryBean trigger(JobDetail job) {
        val trigger = new SimpleTriggerFactoryBean();
        trigger.setJobDetail(job);
        trigger.setStartDelay(START_DELAY_SECS * MILLIS_PER_SEC);
        trigger.setRepeatInterval(REPEAT_INTERVAL_SECS * MILLIS_PER_SEC);
        trigger.setRepeatCount(SimpleTrigger.REPEAT_INDEFINITELY);
        return trigger;
    }
}
----

* include the `QuartzModule` in the application's top-level `AppManifest`.



== More complex use cases

This extension supports a couple of slightly more advanced use cases.

If either are used:

* update the `pom.xml` dependencies:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.causeway.extensions</groupId>
    <artifactId>causeway-extensions-quartz-impl</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

* import the extension's module in your application's top-level `AppManifest`:
+
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        // ...
        CausewayModuleExtQuartzImpl.class,
})
// ...
public class AppManifest {
    // ...
}
----

=== Preserving job state

Sometimes there is a requirement to pass state from one invocation of a job to another.
For example, if some external service is unavailable, then we wouldn't necessarily want to a periodic job to keep trying to connect, creating noise in the logs.

To support this use case, this extension provides the xref:refguide:extensions:index/quartz/context/JobExecutionData.adoc[] class, which simplifies the API of Quartz's job data map.



=== Injecting domain services into jobs

CAUTION: TODO - it's possible this boilerplate may be unnecessary?
xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp]'s job seems to be injected into without this extra rigamorole.

If we want to inject domain services into the Quartz `Job`, then we should define a number of additional beans.
These instantiate xref:refguide:extensions:index/quartz/spring/AutowiringSpringBeanJobFactory.adoc[] as the job factory:

[source,java]
.QuartzModule.java
----
import org.apache.causeway.extensions.quartz.spring.AutowiringSpringBeanJobFactory;

@Configuration
@ComponentScan
public class QuartzModule {

    // ...

    @Bean
    public SpringBeanJobFactory springBeanJobFactory() {
        val jobFactory = new AutowiringSpringBeanJobFactory();  // <.>
        jobFactory.setApplicationContext(applicationContext);
        return jobFactory;
    }

    @Bean
    public SchedulerFactoryBean scheduler(
            final Trigger trigger,
            final JobDetail jobDetail,
            final SpringBeanJobFactory sbjf) {
        val schedulerFactory = new SchedulerFactoryBean();

        schedulerFactory.setJobFactory(sbjf);
        schedulerFactory.setJobDetails(jobDetail);
        schedulerFactory.setTriggers(trigger);

        return schedulerFactory;
    }

    @Bean
    public Scheduler scheduler(
            final Trigger trigger,
            final JobDetail job,
            final SchedulerFactoryBean factory)
            throws SchedulerException {
        val scheduler = factory.getScheduler();
        scheduler.start();
        return scheduler;
    }
