The Excel Library provides the ability to read from  Excel spreadsheets, which can be useful for certain use cases, eg bulk import of data.
Each row of a spreadsheet can be mapped to a domain object, usually a view model.
The view model can validate itself and then apply

The library also provides the opposite use case, converting a collection of domain objects into an Excel spreadsheet.

In addition, the library provides fixture support, allowing test data to be specified in a spreadsheet.
