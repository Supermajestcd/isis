WARNING: TODO: v2 - to fully document

The _commandlog_ module provides an implementation that persists xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command]s using either the xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/EclipseLink] or xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus] object store.

//It further provides a number of supporting services:
//
//* `org.isisaddons.module.command.dom.CommandServiceJdoRepository` is a repository to search for persisted xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command]s
//
//* `org.isisaddons.module.command.dom.CommandServiceJdoContributions` contributes actions for searching for persisted child and sibling xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command]s.
//
//If contributions are not required in the UI, these can be suppressed either using security or by implementing a xref:userguide:btb:hints-and-tips.adoc#vetoing-visibility[vetoing subscriber].
