WARNING: TODO: v2 - to properly document.

The _executionoutbox_ module provides an implementation of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/spi/ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[ExecutionSubscriber] that persists xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/Execution.adoc[Execution]s into an "outbox" (using either the xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/EclipseLink] or xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus] object store).
The purpose of the "outbox" is to act as a temporary store of executions to be propogated to other "downstream" systems.

The module also provides a REST API, a rest client and DTOs to represent the payloads between these two services.
The client polls the outbox through the REST API (for example every 15 seconds), and uses it to download any new executions.
Once processed (eg published to a message bus), the client then uses the same REST API to delete the executions.
